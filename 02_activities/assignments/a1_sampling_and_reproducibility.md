# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitby’s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

```
Population of interest: every person in the city

Sampling frame: 1000 wedding (200) and brunch (800) goers.

10% (100 total) are randomly given a status of "infected".

The model then randomly selects 20% of the infected population to undergo tracing (so 20% of the 10% that are infected, 20 total people). These 20 people are the sample.

If one event has more than 2 infections, the entire sampling frame (n= 200 for wedding, n = 800 for brunch) is tested. 

This code generates the true proportion of infections (e.g., model assumes the brunch goers can also be sampled from/contacted/traced) from weddings (approx 20%).

This simulation is then run 1000 times. What can change on each iteration is the poroprtion of infected people at the brunch or wedding venues, and which of those infected people are traced. 

Because there are 800 and 200 people at brunch and weddings, respectively, approx 20% of the infections will be from weddings, though an infection rate of 0 within the wedding group is possible from just random chance (e.g., the 100 infected people could all be from the brunch group).
